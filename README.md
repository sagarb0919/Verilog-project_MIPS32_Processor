# Verilog-project_MIPS32_Processor
It is simulated on Icarus.
MIPS32.v is the main pipline design.
test_MIPS32_Add.v is testbench for addition operation.
test_bench_factorial.v is test bench for factorial opaertion.
Similary on simulaitng test bench of add and factorial operations we get mips_add.vcd and mips_factorial.vcd files, which has plots that can be viewd at GTKWAVE.
